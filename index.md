### Hi, I'm Cathal.

<i class="ai ai-google-scholar-square ai-3x"></i>

Data scientist currently working on a project collaboration with industry partners BD (Becton, Dickinson & Company). Developing a single cell-multi Omics pipeline with BD's Rhapsody machine. Familiar with shell scripting and working at the command line, among other scripting languages including Python and R. Have demonstrated excellence in all forms of communication, report writing and colleague collaboration in a team setting. Outstanding interpersonal skills and a drive for excellence. Have a keen interest in the biotech landscape in terms of medical technology, bioinformatics and associated products. Looking to apply novel skills in a new dynamic and exciting role.

Recent projects include data analysis of modern high-throughput genomics experiments such as RNA-seq and ChIP-Rx. Set to receive authorship on an upcoming lab publication regarding the childhood cancer called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and in the future on a publication regarding B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

My early training during my bachelor's degree gave me a solid foundation in mathematics, physics, molecular biology and pedagogy. Valuable experience was gained in the secondary education sector and subsequently at a service based biotech company where I moved toward the data science field. In August 2018, I graduated with a MSc in Computational Genomics. The degree centred on the Python and R programming languages and included computational techniques to analyse and visualise large cohorts of datasets; not only in the bioinformatics domain but in any sub division of 'big data'.

My main interests in data science include machine learning, neural networks and data visualisation. Feel free to contact me at cathalgking@gmail.com to find out more. Thanks:)
