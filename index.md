### Hi, I'm Stephen.

<i class="ai ai-google-scholar-square ai-3x"></i>

I'm an assistant professor of Public Health at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. I founded UVA's [Bioinformatics Core](http://bioinformatics.virginia.edu) in 2011 and have since served as director. 

Originally trained in molecular biology, I obtained my PhD in computational genetics and an MS in statistics, and did a postdoc in epidemiology. I work directly with collaborators to provide bioinformatics consulting, study design, and data analysis expertise, working closely with investigators in the experimental design and analysis of genome-scale research, including studies of gene expression, protein-DNA binding, DNA methylation, and DNA variation, and metagenomics, using both array and next-generation sequencing technologies.

I have worked in the DoD community for several years, and I'm also a registered United States patent agent.
