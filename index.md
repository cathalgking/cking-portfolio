### Hi, I'm Cathal.

<i class="ai ai-google-scholar-square ai-3x"></i>



I am a data scientist in the University of Limerick (UL). I am currently working on bioinformatic datasets and my main duties include inferring metrics, descriptive statistics and making visualisations from sequencing and proteomic datasets. Recent projects include data analysis of modern high-throughput genomics experiments such as RNA-seq and ChIP-Rx. Set to receive authorship on an upcoming lab publication regarding the childhood cancer called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and in the future on a publication regarding B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

I am also working on a collaboration project with BD (Becton, Dickinson & Company) and UL. Part of the project aims to develop a Single Cell Sequencing Pixilation Device. The device functions by physically cutting the individual tissue pixels into tapered channels / pores where enzymatic reactions are performed to dissociate the cells. A parameter to be studied through different variants is the performance of the device with different grid array size and the outlet size of the channel / pore from which the cells are dispensed into the Base Wells where PCR analysis will be performed.

My early training during my bachelor's degree gave me a solid foundation in mathematics, physics, molecular biology and pedagogy. Valuable experience was gained in the secondary education sector and subsequently at a service based biotech company where I moved toward the data science field. In August 2018, I graduated with a MSc in Computational Genomics. The degree centred on the Python and R programming languages and included computational techniques to analyse and visualise large cohorts of datasets; not only in the bioinformatics domain but in any sub division of 'big data'.

My main interests in data science include machine learning, neural networks and data visualisation. Feel free to contact me at cathalgking@gmail.com to find out more. Thanks:)
