### Hi, I'm Cathal.

<i class="ai ai-google-scholar-square ai-3x"></i>

I am a data scientist at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. My main duties include inferring metrics, descriptive statistics and making visualisations from sequencing datasets. Currently specialising in the medical space with respect to genomics and bioinformatics. Recent projects include data analysis of modern high-throughput genomics experiments such as RNA-seq and ChIP-Rx. Set to receive authorship on an upcoming lab publication regarding the childhood cancer called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and in the future on a publication regarding B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 

My early training during my bachelor's degree gave me a solid foundation in mathematics, physics, molecular biology and pedagogy. Valuable experience was gained in the secondary education sector and subsequently at a service based biotech company where I moved toward the data science field. In August 2018, I graduated with a MSc in Computational Genomics. The degree centred on the Python and R programming languages and included computational techniques to analyse and visualise large cohorts of datasets; not only in the bioinformatics domain but in any sub division of 'big data'.

My main interests in data science include machine learning, neural networks and data visualisation. Feel free to contact me to find out more or check out my YouTube channel which shows some of my visualisations.
