## **A collection of some of my previous data visualisations**

#### Interactive visualisations can have many benefits over static images in terms of data manipulation especially for multi-layered data. Below, I utilize existing technology to help tell the data story.

### **A 3D PCA plot**
#### Click, drag and mouse over the data points in this 3D scatter plot. The plot shows a Principal Component (PC) Analysis on RNA sequencing data from 3 locations of the brain (Cortex, Hindbrain & Striatum) and are plotted as 3 colours. A PC analysis is a common first step on most data types to observe any clustering of the data (if any).  

#### One advantage of 3D here is that it can reveal more complex interactions between data points as opposed to a standard 2D plot. For example, the yellow diamond shaped points (representing hind brain) can appear to be more closely related than they actually are when only viewed on the first and 2nd PC. Generated with the Plotly package.

### **Electoral Divisions within Galway City & County, Ireland**

#### The County Galway area is partitioned by electoral constituency. Mouse over the map and click on the constituency of interest. As an extra layer of data, Vacancy Rates (the % of rental units not rented) in 2011 was added as a pop up which was taken from Census data. Mapping visualisations provide enhanced understanding and context of the region of interest and can present a wide range of information at once.
