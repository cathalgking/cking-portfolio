### **A collection of some of my previous data visualisations**

#### Interactive visualisations can have many benefits over static images in terms of data manipulation especially for multi-layered data. Below, I utilize existing technology to help tell the data story.

### **A 3D PCA plot**
#### Click, drag and mouse over the data points in this 3D scatter plot. The plot shows a Principal Component (PC) Analysis on RNA sequencing data from 3 locations of the brain (Cortex, Hindbrain & Striatum) and are plotted as 3 colours. A PC analysis is a common first step on most data types to observe any clustering of the data (if any).  

#### One advantage of 3D here is that it can reveal more complex interactions between data points as opposed to a standard 2D plot. For example, the yellow diamond shaped points (representing hind brain) can appear to be more closely related than they actually are when only viewed on the first and 2nd PC.
