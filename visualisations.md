###A collection of some of my previous works (in development)
<br>
**Query genes/variants related to a human disease**
[This short report](https://rawcdn.githack.com/cathalgking/cking-portfolio/278cd427b6e266f308af897c88c3e009f705b5db/Colonic_tumours_GeneList.html "Image source") searches for and plots the genes most associated with a disease of interest, using the MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) with the disgenet2r R package. Colorectal Neoplasms are used as an example.
<br>
**Genetic variants associated with chemo-resistance/recurrence in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)**
[This Thesis](https://rawcdn.githack.com/cathalgking/MSc-Thesis/14399151241cecb1507effe8ab4562942c20b6b5/Thesis_Write_Up_Cathal_King_17235058.pdf "Image source") was part of the MSc in Computational Genomics at NUI Galway. It uses the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best practice workflow along with the Picard suite of preprocessing tools to identify mutational signatures in 3 HNSCC patients.
<br>
**RShiny Prediction App**
[This RShiny app](https://cathalgking.shinyapps.io/Shiny_Prediction_App/ "Image source") takes student test results and predicts future grade levels. It is based upon a pre-built Regularized Logistic Regression model generated using the caret R package.
<br>
**More Data Mining with Weka**
[This course](https://www.futurelearn.com/certificates/j2mnf9c "Image source") taught advanced data mining skills using the Weka workbench.
<br>
**SQL Fundamentals course**
[This course](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-5aa9fd82-0946-4b30-9df9-7001ba87c484/) taught SQL fundamentals such as filtering and retrieving data using SQL Queries such as SELECT,WHERE, LIMIT and more.

**Poster**
[This poster](https://rawcdn.githack.com/cathalgking/MSc-Thesis/14399151241cecb1507effe8ab4562942c20b6b5/Thesis_Write_Up_Cathal_King_17235058.pdf "Image source") was presented.

**Populations Chart**
The Highcharts JavaScript package is aesthetically pleasing and produces useful interactive features. Mouse over the points to reveal the exact data point. [This Plot](https://rawcdn.githack.com/cathalgking/cking-portfolio/8f1fbf23d429a495d5f2791dd86a2b83abe1c28f/populations.html "Image source") shows the population of Ireland, New Zealand and Iceland from 1990 to 2014.
<br>
**A 3D PCA plot**
[This PCA plot](https://rawcdn.githack.com/cathalgking/cking-portfolio/039953c95d095c112387ba83529ec3d8d1b6a9c8/3D_PCA_Plotly.html "Image source") displays 3 locations of the brain on 3D Space. Click, drag and mouse over the data points. A Principal Component (PC) Analysis on RNA-seq data from 3 locations of the brain (Cortex, Hindbrain & Striatum) are plotted as 3 colours. A PC analysis is a common first step on most data types to observe any clustering of the data (if any). One advantage of 3D here is that it can reveal more complex interactions between data points as opposed to a standard 2D plot. For example, the yellow diamond shaped points (representing hind brain) can appear to be more closely related than they actually are when only viewed on the first and 2nd PC. Generated with the Plotly package.

**Electoral Divisions within Galway City & County, Ireland**
[This Visualisation](https://rawcdn.githack.com/cathalgking/cking-portfolio/039953c95d095c112387ba83529ec3d8d1b6a9c8/03_geojson_Altered.html "Image source") shows the County Galway area which is partitioned by electoral constituency. Mouse over the map and click on the constituency of interest. As an extra layer of data, Vacancy Rates (the % of rental units not rented) in 2011 was added as a pop up which was taken from Census data. Mapping visualisations provide enhanced understanding and context of the region of interest and can present a wide range of information at once. Generated using the Leaflet library for interactive maps.
